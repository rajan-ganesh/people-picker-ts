### Building and running your application

You will need to have Docker installed to run this application in a container.
(Suggested, for easy cleanup, and management of dependencies)


When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

Alternatively, run it outside a container, directly on your machine, with `npm start`
(After downloading dependencies)

Your application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
