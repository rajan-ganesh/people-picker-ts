## Zepto hiring Coding Challenge

### Features implemented:

#### For extra brownie points, the entire project is containerised with DOCKER!

- Item list popup shows up on clicking input field
- List automatically filters to what you type
- Clicking an item turns it into a chip at the top, removing it from list
- Chips are self aligning
- Chips can be removed and added back to items list with x button
- Items can also be selected from list with up/down arrows
- Project can be run either traditionally, with `npm start`, or with docker by running `docker compose up --build`
- (Runs on localhost 3000)

#### Bonus Features Implemented:

- Code is clean, modular, extensible and follows naming convention
- Uses TypeScript
- No libraries used, all code from scratch
- Pressing backspace when input field is empty makes the last chip turn pink
- Pressing backspace again will delete it and add it back into the list
- Adding a new element when one is highlighted will automatically remove the highlight
